Some solutions about calculating multiple numbers which has more than 2^5 characters

I have some solutions for that question
- create a class named LargeNumber, which contained more an more
Step[1] I use 1 string of characters from '0' to '9'

Step[2] From rightmost to leftmost:
+ take one by one character and convert to int
+ doing work with those characters (add, sub, multiple, divide, modulo and etc...)

Step[3] Reconvert form from int to character and synchronize those characters to one string

Step[4] // if that's neccessary
+ create a new vector of LargeNumber to store more LargeNumbers - like multiple adding and go bruhhh

Step[5] // if that's neccessary
+ I don't know any thing and write down overhere
